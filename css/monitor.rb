## monitor.rb
## Monitors files for changes and runs command on change.

# This is the command to run when a file changes. Variables:
# * file: The full file name, path and extension of the changed file.
# * file_name: The name and path of the changed file (no extension).
# * file_extension: The extension of the changed file.
Command = "sass file file_name.css"

# This is the extension of files to watch for changes.
# Asterisk means to watch all files.
Extension = "sass"

# If you use HSS, use the following configuration:
# * Command = "hss file"
# * Extension = "hss"
